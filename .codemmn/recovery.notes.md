### 🔹 Starting a Constant Variable Declaration

```javascript
const
```

**Explanation:**
*   **Concept:** This line begins the declaration of a variable that, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned to a different value later in your code.
*   **How it's working ?**
    *   `const`: This is a JavaScript keyword used to declare a constant. It signals that the variable you are about to define will hold a value that should not change during the program's execution.
*   **Key Syntax:** `const`
